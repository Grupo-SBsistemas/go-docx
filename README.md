   <b>go-docx</b> provides a way to replace all placeholders with confidence, even
   if they are separated within the documents.

* **Simple**: The API exposed is kept to a minimum in order to stick to the purpose.
* **Fast**: go-docx is fast since it operates directly on the byte contents instead mapping the XMLs to a custom data struct.
* **Zero dependencies**: go-docx is build with the go stdlib only.
