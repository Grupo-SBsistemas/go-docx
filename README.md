   <b>Replace placeholders inside docx documents with speed and confidence.</b>
   
   <p align="center"><sub>This project provides a simple and clean API to perform replacing of user-defined placeholders.   
   Without the uncertainty that the placeholders may be ripped  aparty by the WordprocessingML engine used to create the document.</sub></p>

* **Simple**: The API exposed is kept to a minimum in order to stick to the purpose.
* **Fast**: go-docx is fast since it operates directly on the byte contents instead mapping the XMLs to a custom data struct.
* **Zero dependencies**: go-docx is build with the go stdlib only.
